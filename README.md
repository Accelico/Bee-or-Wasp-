# Bee-or-Wasp-
CNN binary classifier for bees and wasps
This is a CNN model trained on nearly 4000 images of bees and wasps.

To operate this notebook, press run all under the runtime tab. Then wait for the model to train itself.
Once the model is trained, go ahead and run the last cell, an upload button should prompt you to upload
either an image of a wasp or bee to see if the model can identify the picture!
Here's the colab link for it to run in a colab notebook: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13ky-kZ4Zx5YmYPohts0Q2YiPxbqc19FL?usp=sharing
